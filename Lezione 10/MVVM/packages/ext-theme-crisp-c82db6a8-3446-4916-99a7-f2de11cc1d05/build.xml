    The build-impl.xml file imported here contains the guts of the build process. It is
    a great idea to read that file to understand how the process works, but it is best to
    limit your changes to this file.

    The following targets can be provided to inject logic before and/or after key steps
    of the build process:

        The "init-local" target is used to initialize properties that may be personalized
        for the local machine.

            <target name="-before-init-local"/>
            <target name="-after-init-local"/>

        The "clean" target is used to clean build output from the build.dir.

            <target name="-before-clean"/>
            <target name="-after-clean"/>

        The general "init" target is used to initialize all other properties, including
        those provided by Sencha Cmd.

            <target name="-before-init"/>
            <target name="-after-init"/>
        
        The "build" target performs the call to Sencha Cmd to build the application.

            <target name="-before-build"/>
            <target name="-after-build"/>
